## PROMPT

Create a 90-second whiteboard animation video promoting PsPatchMyPC, an enterprise PowerShell module for application patching.

**Visual Style:** Hand-drawn whiteboard/chalkboard with dark background. Elements appear as if being sketched in real-time.

**Scene 1 (0:00-0:30):** 
- Title: "Enterprise Patching is Broken" (red chalk)
- Draw: Frustrated IT admin stick figure, scattered computers with question marks, popup interrupting user, cracked security shield
- Text: "Result: Security Risk + Unhappy Users"
- **Narration:** "Enterprise application patching is broken. IT teams struggle with manual updates, losing track of which machines need patches. Users get interrupted at the worst times. Security gaps pile up, and compliance audits become nightmares. There has to be a better way."

**Scene 2 (0:30-0:45):**
- Wipe board clean
- Logo: "PsPatchMyPC" in cyan/blue with PowerShell brackets [ ]
- Tagline: "Enterprise Patching, Reimagined"
- **Narration:** "Introducing PsPatchMyPC. A PowerShell module that reimagines enterprise patching by combining the power of Microsoft's winget with intelligent automation and user-friendly controls."

**Scene 3 (0:45-1:15):**
- Central circle: "winget powered"
- Connect four features:
  1. Gear icon → "Automatic Updates" → "Set it and forget it"
  2. Clock with snooze → "Smart Deferrals" → "Users stay in control"
  3. Network nodes → "Intune • FleetDM • SCCM" → "Works with your tools"
  4. Document with check → "CMTrace + Event Logs" → "Audit-ready always"
- **Narration:** "PsPatchMyPC delivers four game-changing capabilities. First, automatic updates powered by winget—set it and forget it. Second, smart progressive deferrals that give users control while maintaining security deadlines. Third, seamless integration with your existing tools—Intune, FleetDM, SCCM, and more. And fourth, comprehensive logging in CMTrace format plus Windows Event Log, so you're always audit-ready."

**Scene 4 (1:15-1:30):**
- Large tagline: "Patch Smarter. Not Harder."
- PowerShell terminal window with command typing: `Install-Module -Name PsPatchMyPC`
- Two boxes: "PowerShell Gallery" and "GitHub"
- Footer: "MIT License • Open Source • Free Forever"
- **Narration:** "Ready to transform your patching workflow? Install PsPatchMyPC from the PowerShell Gallery or get it on GitHub. It's open source, MIT licensed, and free forever. Patch smarter, not harder."

**Voice:** Professional, confident, technical but accessible, American English, moderate pace (150-160 WPM)

**Colors:** Cyan/blue (#00d9ff) for branding, red/orange for problems, green/purple for solutions, dark chalkboard background
