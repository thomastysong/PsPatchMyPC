### For D-ID, Synthesia, or Similar:
```
Create a 90-second whiteboard animation video with AI-generated narration. 

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard/chalkboard aesthetic with dark background. Elements should appear as if being drawn by hand in real-time.

Scene 1 (0:00-0:30): Show "Enterprise Patching is Broken" title, then draw frustrated IT admin, scattered computers with question marks, user interruption popup, and cracked security shield. Narrate the pain points.

Scene 2 (0:30-0:45): Wipe board clean, reveal "PsPatchMyPC" logo with PowerShell brackets, add tagline "Enterprise Patching, Reimagined".

Scene 3 (0:45-1:15): Draw central "winget powered" hub, then connect four feature nodes: Automatic Updates, Smart Deferrals, Intune/FleetDM/SCCM integration, and CMTrace/Event Log logging. Narrate each feature.

Scene 4 (1:15-1:30): Display "Patch Smarter. Not Harder." tagline, show PowerShell terminal with typing command "Install-Module -Name PsPatchMyPC", add PowerShell Gallery and GitHub links, footer with MIT License info.
