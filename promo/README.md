# PsPatchMyPC Whiteboard Animation Promo

This directory contains scripts and prompts for generating a whiteboard animation video promoting PsPatchMyPC using AI video generation tools.

## Files

- **`WHITEBOARD_ANIMATION_SCRIPT.md`** - Comprehensive script with detailed scene descriptions, timing, and narration
- **`AI_PROMPT_SHORT.md`** - Condensed prompt ready to paste into AI video tools
- **`src/`** - React-based implementation (alternative approach, may require Node.js setup)

## Recommended Approach: AI Video Generation

Instead of building the animation from scratch, use AI video generation tools that specialize in whiteboard animations with voice narration.

### Quick Start

1. **Choose a tool:**
   - [D-ID](https://www.d-id.com/) - Professional whiteboard animations
   - [Synthesia](https://www.synthesia.io/) - AI avatars with whiteboard backgrounds
   - [VideoScribe](https://www.videoscribe.co/) - Specialized whiteboard tool
   - [Powtoon](https://www.powtoon.com/) - Easy whiteboard templates
   - [Pictory](https://pictory.ai/) or [InVideo](https://invideo.io/) - AI video from scripts

2. **Use the script:**
   - Open `AI_PROMPT_SHORT.md`
   - Copy the entire prompt
   - Paste into your chosen tool
   - Select "whiteboard animation" style
   - Choose professional AI voice
   - Generate video

3. **Review and export:**
   - Preview the generated video
   - Adjust timing if needed
   - Export as MP4 (1080p recommended)

### What You Get

- **90-second animated video** showing:
  - Problem: Enterprise patching pain points
  - Solution: PsPatchMyPC introduction
  - Features: Four key capabilities
  - Call to action: Installation command and links

- **Professional AI narration** explaining the product

## Alternative: React Implementation

If you prefer to build it yourself, the `src/` directory contains a React + Framer Motion implementation. However, this requires:
- Node.js and npm installed
- Running `npm install` and `npm run dev`
- More technical setup

The AI video generation approach is recommended for faster, professional results with minimal technical overhead.

## Customization
